## PURPOSE
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the August data of the NYC Citibike program. 
This data can then be used to see if bike programs can be viable in other cities.

## RESULTS

This slide is identical to the prior, except it is now broken down by gender. This slide shows that despite gender differences, most riders check their bike out within the first 10 minutes of the hour.

This slide shows the hours when bikes were checked out during the month of August. As can be seen, most bikes were either checked out in the morning or the evening. 


## Summary
These results reveal a few tendencies of NYC bike riders. Firstly, the majority of riders are men and are also subscribers. Most of the riders being subscribers tells us that these people are frequent bikers. To retain such a large portion of the customer base means the program must be doing something right. Furthermore, with most of the rides occurring on weekdays and typically between 7am-9am and 5pm-6pm coincide with the beginning and end of a workday. This tells us that a lot of people take the bikes to work. 
One visualization that would be interesting to see is the start and end locations divided by gender. It would be interesting to see if there is a difference between genders as to where they receive and drop off the bikes. 
Another visualization to see would be further filter the trip duration over age by gender. The original visualization already tells us that younger riders typically ride longer. However, the purpose of the new visualization is to see if men or women ride the bikes longer.
